Match the Members

Description:
This is a trivia game to help learn the names of the members of MDB. A player has 5 seconds to answer each question which consists of identifying the name of the individual in a picture displayed. A player gets one point for each correct answer, and nothing happens if they get an incorrect answer. Players can pause the game, however, their score will reset if they do so. Additionally, players can view their longest streak of correct answers and the results of their last three questions on the statistics page.
